                <h2>LOREM IPSUM</h2>
                <p> DescriptionIn publishing and graphic design, Lorem ipsum is a placeholder text commonly used to
                    demonstrate the visual form of a document or a typeface without relying on meaningful content. Lorem
                    ipsum may be used as a placeholder before final copy is available.</p>
                <p> Red is iconic in many other realms as well.</p>
                <p> Red is widely associated with being the color of love (both romantic and courtly) and passion. </p>
                <p>Red roses are considered the ultimate romantic gift on Valentine’s Day. </p>
                <p> This practice likely dates back to the Roman de la Rose, a French poem from the thirteenth century
                    that was one of the most well-known and beloved pieces of literature in the Middle Ages. The poem
                    (whose title translates to Romance of the Rose in English) was an allegorical journey where the
                    author searches for a red rose in a secluded garden, where the red rose symbolized the woman the
                    author loved. </p>
                <p>There is also an entire discipline called floriography, which means the language of the flowers: in
                    it, people can use flowers to a send a secret message to their recipient. In the Victorian era, when
                    it was frowned upon to be to open with romantic feeling, floriography provided people the means to
                    communicate their most closely guarded feelings. In floriography, red roses simply meant “I love
                    you”, and that message carries through to this day.</p>
